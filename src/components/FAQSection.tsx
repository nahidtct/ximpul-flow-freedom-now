    question: "What is Ximpul?",
    answer: "Ximpul is a lifestyle brand from Bangladesh dedicated to bringing global-quality products to people at #TruePrice — with full transparency and no compromise on innovation or product integrity."
  }, {
    question: "What is Ximpul Flow?",
    answer: "Ximpul Flow is our first initiative — a premium water bottle designed to help people carry their own safe, clean water, and contribute to making water free again — instead of paying again and again for bottled water."
  }, {
    question: "What does #TruePrice mean?",
    answer: "#TruePrice means you get the same factory quality as premium global brands — without paying an inflated brand price. It also means we don't sell fake \"factory-direct\" scrap. Every product is fully curated, tested, and guaranteed."
  }, {
    question: "Is Ximpul trying to copy other brands?",
    answer: "No. We do not copy brands. We source from top factories and work to bring equal or better quality products to Bangladesh — under our own brand, at honest prices."
  }, {
    question: "Why is packaging so simple?",
    answer: "We believe your money should go to the product, not the box. Our simple, eco-friendly packaging helps reduce waste and keeps the focus on delivering real value."
  }, {
    question: "Is there any compromise on product quality?",
    answer: "Never. Every Ximpul product is selected through strict quality control. Our mission is to deliver global quality at #TruePrice — without compromise."
  }, {
    question: "What types of products will Ximpul offer in the future?",
    answer: "We will gradually introduce lifestyle products across multiple categories: hydration, personal accessories, home, travel — always following our brand philosophy: The best. For all. At #TruePrice."
